=============
payroll.cpp
=============
A basic payroll class with data members for name, pay rate, and number of hours
worked. Objects of this class may be used with any of the included list types.

=============
SULibTest.cpp
=============
Driver file. It contains the main function which displays all tests for the
following list files.

=============
SUList.cpp
=============
A templated doubly-linked list. Items can be appended to or retrieved from its
front or back. It also serves as the basis for class SUQueueList.

=============
SUQueue.cpp
=============
Contains two templated classes, SUQueueArr and SUQueueList. The former contains
an array data member to which items may only be appended to the front or
retrieved from the back (follows FIFO principle). The latter contains an SUList
object which is restricted to work as a queue.

=============
SUStack.cpp
=============
Contains two templated classes, SUStackArr and SUStackList. The former contains
an array data member which follows the LIFO principle, and the latter contains
a list data member that is restricted to work as a stack.

=============
SUTree.cpp
=============
Templated binary search tree with functions to insert, delete, and search
pre-order, in-order, and post-order.



Bonus features implemented:
  Overloaded output stream operators for all classes
  Overloaded [] operator for SUList
  Method to sort the SUList by using the comparison operator for DataType
  Re-implementation of Project 1
  Re-implementation of Project 2
  Binary search tree
