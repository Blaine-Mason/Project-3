/**
 * This program provides a slightly-more-than-minimal
 * example of a program that makes use of the various
 * classes defined in the SULibrary project. It tests
 * only some of the SUList an SUStack methods, with
 * some output to verify the results.
 *
 * It only runs partial tests for three of the classes.
 * You should write more on your own, but this can
 * serve as a sanity-check to get started.
 *
 * Be sure to think about edge cases!
 *
 * Must be compiled with:
 *  - PayRoll class method definitions
 *  - Templated definitions
